# Nethunter_KSU_Module

First of all, this module is not my original, a lot of code comes from KaliNethunter official magisk module.

Here is how to use it:

1. Download a suitable rootfs from
https://kali.download/nethunter-images/current/rootfs/

2. Move this rootfs directly to the root directory of the module, then compress it into a zip file, and use KernelSU to flash it in.
